Codebook

read in the data
read in the features as column name
read in the original test and training data, three files per test and training

combine the test and training data together as “test” and “train”
combine all the data together to get the dataframe “merged”

select all variable which name contain mean or std to list “selectedvars”
add “subject” and “activity” to this list for subset the “merged” data frame

subset the “merged” data frame by matching the column names, and stored as “selected”

name each activity by using activity as factor
the code is 

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

group the data frame by subject and activity, then calculate the mean of each variables, and stored in a new data frame named “means”

write “means” as table in txt file.




Code for results table

Subject  30
	The 30 subjects in the study

activity 6
	the activities that a subject performed in the study
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING
		STANDING
		LAYING

The rest variables please refer to the features_info.txt in the original dataset. In general, xx..mean indicates the mean of the feature xx , and xx..std indicates the standard deviation of the feature xx.

Each entries in the table, expect the first two columns, is the average of the specific feature of the correspond subject performing the correspond activity.
