# Getting_and_cleaning_data_project

Data were download from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

After download and unzip the data, change the R working directory to where the data is. By default it will be like:
/user/downloads/UCI HAR Dataset. Change the /user/downloads part as needed.

Then you are ready to run the R script in this repo.
